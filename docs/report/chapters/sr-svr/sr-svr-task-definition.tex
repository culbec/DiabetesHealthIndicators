\subsection{Problem specification}
\label{svr-task}

\par This problem proposes to solve the issue of predicting the diabetes risk score, based on social \& health indicators. The \textit{diabetes risk score} is a computed integer value based on the proposed social \& health indicators, ranging between $[0, 100]$. Based on the proposed features, the solution will provide a \textit{risk score} within the same range, indicating the likelihood of a patient having the medical condition.

\subsubsection{Learning Task}

\par This section presents the formalization of the learning task regarding the presented problem, accounting the features proposed to solve the problem and the goal provided by the solution. The specification of the learning task is presented below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Task (T)}: Predict the diabetes risk score.
	\item \textbf{Performance (P)}: Quality of the resulted prediction, represented by how accurate is the prediction with respect to the real value.
	\item \textbf{Experience (E)}: Prediction of the diabetes risk score on a large set of labeled training instances.
\end{itemize}

\par The above described task will be solved through an empirical analysis, driven by data patterns rather than explicit programming.
